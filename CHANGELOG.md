## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-26

### Overview
Initial public release of the YouTube Transcriber project - a comprehensive toolkit for downloading YouTube audio and converting it to text using OpenAI's Whisper models. This project provides multiple implementations optimized for different use cases, from simple single-video transcription to batch processing and API server deployment.

### Added
- **Core Transcription Functionality**
  - YouTube audio download pipeline using yt-dlp
  - Speech-to-text processing with multiple Whisper implementations
  - Support for OpenAI Whisper and faster-whisper libraries
  - Model selection from tiny (fastest) to large (most accurate)
  - Automatic language detection with probability scores

- **GUI Applications**
  - `youtube_transcriber.py` - Full-featured GUI with batch processing capabilities
  - `faster_whisper_transcriber.py` - Optimized version using faster-whisper for better performance
  - `simple_transcriber.py` - Minimal single-video transcription tool
  - Cross-platform tkinter-based interface with progress tracking
  - Threaded processing to prevent UI freezing

- **Modular Architecture**
  - `stt_utils.py` - Extracted reusable STT functionality for integration into other applications
  - High-level and low-level APIs for different use cases
  - Comprehensive utility functions for file handling and transcript formatting

- **REST API Server**
  - `whisper_api.py` - FastAPI-based REST API for audio transcription
  - Support for multiple audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG, WMA, AAC)
  - API key authentication with configurable security
  - CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
  - File size validation and error handling
  - Comprehensive API documentation

- **Build and Deployment**
  - PyInstaller specifications for creating standalone executables
  - Windows batch launcher script
  - Virtual environment setup instructions
  - Separate dependency files for GUI and API components

- **Documentation and Configuration**
  - Comprehensive CLAUDE.md with development guidance
  - Environment configuration with .env.example
  - Sample video list (Videos.xlsx) for batch processing
  - Security documentation for API deployment

### Technical Features
- **Performance Optimizations**
  - CPU-based processing with int8 quantization in faster-whisper
  - Automatic temporary file cleanup
  - Memory-efficient audio processing pipeline

- **Error Handling and Validation**
  - Dependency checking with graceful failure recovery
  - Input validation for URLs and file formats
  - Comprehensive error messages and logging

- **Flexibility and Extensibility**
  - Multiple Whisper model options for speed/accuracy trade-offs
  - Configurable output formats and timestamp inclusion
  - Modular design for easy integration into other projects

### Security
- Mandatory API key authentication for REST API endpoints
- Configurable CORS settings for production deployment
- Input sanitization and file validation
- No sensitive data logging or exposure
